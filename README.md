## Introduction

The **Student Management System** is a Java-based console application designed to simplify student record management within educational institutions. This system enables administrators to easily handle student data, including adding, deleting, updating, and querying student information, as well as user authentication and password recovery.

## Features

- **Login:** Authenticate users to access the Student Management System.
- **Register:** Allow new users to create accounts with the required information.
- **Forgot Password:** Provide password recovery functionality.
- **Add Students:** Add new students to the system by providing their ID, name, age, and city.
- **Delete Students:** Remove students from the system using their unique ID.
- **Update Students:** Modify student details such as name, age, and city.
- **Query Students:** View a comprehensive list of all registered students.
- **Exit:** Close the application.

## Technologies and Concepts

This project leverages various technologies and programming concepts, including:

- **Java:** The primary programming language used to implement the application.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Organizing code into classes and objects for better structure and maintainability.
- **ArrayList:** Utilizing dynamic arrays to manage student objects effectively.
- **User Input Handling:** Employing the `Scanner` class to capture user input for interactions.
- **Conditional Statements and Loops:** Creating decision-making logic and repetitive processes.
- **User Authentication:** Implementing user login functionality for secure access.
- **Password Recovery:** Allowing users to recover forgotten passwords.
- **Git and GitHub:** Version control and collaborative development via Git and GitHub.
